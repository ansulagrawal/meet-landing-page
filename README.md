# Meet Landing Page

![preview of meet landing page challenge](./preview.jpg)

This is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). Coded by [Ansul](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/ansulagrawal)! 😁

Welcome to the repository for this project. Feel free to look around and expore! 😀

### Tools used

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/)
- [ScrollTrigger](https://greensock.com/scrolltrigger/)
- [smooth-scrollbar](https://idiotwu.github.io/smooth-scrollbar/)

### Development

I decided to build this app using Svelte. Svelte is an awesome compiler where everything feels like it just makes sense. I already knew that I liked Svelte, but this experience made me realize that I love Svelte! 😍

Adding animations was a breeze with GSAP and ScrollTrigger. Both are great tools that make animating things fairly easy and very fun! I used smooth-scrollbar to soften the scrolling of the page and customize the appearance of the scroll bar. 😀

### Notes

I think some things like the tablet/mobile animations and perhaps accessibility might need some tweaking. I'm always open to ideas and suggestions, so please do let me know if you have anything to say! 👍
